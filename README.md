### üëâ Getting started
 Getting started with Ignitechase is a straightforward process that requires a few key tools and packages. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps needed to install Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, and Pipenv, and get you up and running with Ignitechase.

##### Step 1: Install Python
 Before you can start using Ignitechase, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to install Python on your system.
   
##### Step 2: Install Pipenv
  Pipenv is a package manager that is used to manage Python packages and dependencies. To install Pipenv, open a terminal window and enter the following command    
 ```
  pip install pipenv
 ```
This will install Pipenv on your system.
    
##### Step 3: Create a new virtual environment
  Next, you will need to create a new virtual environment. Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that let you manage and package your Python packages without worrying about conflicts.
  ```
  pipenv shell
  ```
This will create a new virtual environment.

##### Step 4: Install required packages
 With your virtual environment activated, you can now install the required packages for Ignitechase. Enter the following commands in your terminal window:
 ```
  pip install streamlit plotly pandas
 ```
  This will install the Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas packages.

##### Step 5: Clone the repo
  Finally, you can install Ignitechase by entering the following command in your terminal window:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/manish7017/IgniteChase.git
 ```
 This will install Ignitechase and all its dependencies.

##### Step 6: Start using Ignitechase
 With Ignitechase installed, you can start using it by running the following command in your terminal window:
  
  ```
   streamlit run your_app.py

   ```
  Replace your_app.py with the name of your Ignitechase app. This will start a Streamlit server and launch your Ignitechase app in your web browser.

 Congratulations! You are now ready to start using Ignitechase to visualize and analyze your data.
